# Impostor - Social Deduction Game 🎭

A real-time multiplayer web game where players must identify the impostor among them through discussion and voting.

## 🎮 How to Play

1. **Create a Room**: One player creates a room and becomes the admin
2. **Join**: Other players join using the room code (minimum 3 players)
3. **Configure**: Admin sets the number of rounds and adds secret words
4. **Play**: Each round, one random player is the impostor
   - Most players see the secret word
   - The impostor sees "IMPOSTOR" instead
5. **Discuss**: Players discuss (via video call or in-person) to figure out who doesn't know the word
6. **Vote**: All players vote for who they think is the impostor
7. **Score**: If the impostor is caught, others get a point. If not, the impostor gets a point

### Optional: AI Word Generation

To enable AI-powered word generation with Google Gemini:

1. Get a free API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)
2. Create a `.env` file in the project root:
   ```bash
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

**Note**: The game works perfectly fine without AI - you can manually add words. AI is just a convenient bonus feature!
